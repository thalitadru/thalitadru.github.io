I'am an academic in Computer science and this is my professional webpage.
It's main purpose is to host together information about my career, projects I take part in and classes I teach.

The content is being incrementally build, so if you find some almost-empty pages, it is because they have not been worked on at: they're just place holders <span><i class="far fa-fw fa-smile"></i></span>
