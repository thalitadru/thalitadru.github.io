I prepared this session to work it with students in the Cognitive Sciences masters degree, who were taking the Computational Neuroscience class.
They had a very diverse packground in terms of programming skills, so I tried to simplify the lab assignments so that all of them could follow.

You can see the class materials [here](https://github.com/thalitadru/CoursMasterSciencesCognitives). For the computer assignments (_travaux pratiques_) I did borrow heavily from PyTorch oficial tutorials, so any similarities are not mere coincidence :)
